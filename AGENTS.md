# AGENTS.md

This is the entry point for **any** coding agent working in this
repository — Claude Code, Devin, GitHub Copilot (coding agent or Chat), or
anything else that reads this file. Read it first, then follow §1 before
doing anything else. Nothing here is tool-specific; it's plain
instructions and plain files any agent can read with normal file tools.

## What this project is

A small Spring Boot REST service (library book catalog + member lending)
that exists to demonstrate a **spec-driven, multi-persona (Product Owner /
Tech Lead / Developer / QA), requirement-traceable delivery process** —
both goals are real: it's a working service, and it's a template for
running that process on any new project, with any agent. See
`docs/03-spec-driven-development-playbook.md` for the process itself and
`tracker/PROJECT_TRACKER.md` for this project's complete, dated history
from requirement to sign-off.

## §1. Before doing anything: read these, in order

1. `docs/00-roles-and-responsibilities.md` — the four personas and what
   each owns. (A note on enforcement: this repo also ships Claude
   Code–specific subagents at `.claude/agents/*.md` that give Claude Code
   *hard* tool-restricted enforcement of each persona — e.g. the Product
   Owner subagent literally has no shell access. If you're a different
   agent without an equivalent mechanism, treat this document as the
   convention to follow deliberately instead.)
2. `docs/01-po-requirements.md` — the PRD. Binding scope and acceptance
   criteria.
3. `docs/02-techlead-design.md` — the architecture, package layout, and
   the design decisions named explicitly (e.g. why "overdue" is computed,
   not stored).
4. `docs/03-spec-driven-development-playbook.md` — the process: ID
   conventions, the resume protocol, the propose-new-work protocol,
   copy-paste templates. **Read this before creating any new tracker or
   matrix row.**
5. `docs/04-new-requirement-intake.md` — exactly what to type for a new
   request, and what happens automatically as a result.
6. `traceability/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` — per requirement, what design
   section, what code, and what tests cover it right now.
7. `tracker/PROJECT_TRACKER.md` — the actual history. Read end to end,
   especially the last rows, "Open Items / Blockers", and the "Phase
   Overview" checklist.

If asked to "continue the project" with no further detail, those seven
reads are the entire briefing needed — resume at whatever the tracker's
last state says is next, in the appropriate persona, logging the same way
every prior entry did. (Claude Code: `/resume-project` runs this for you.)

## Starting new work — works with any agent, no special syntax required

State the *what* and *why* in a sentence or two — that's the entire input
needed. Say it as plain language, e.g.:

> Follow the propose-new-work protocol in
> `docs/03-spec-driven-development-playbook.md` §6 for this requirement:
> let a member place a hold on a fully-borrowed book, and notify them when
> it's returned.

Every agent reading this file can act on that sentence the same way: read
§1 above, then work the request through Product Owner → Tech Lead →
Developer → QA, in persona, logging each step exactly as
`docs/03-spec-driven-development-playbook.md` §6 and §7 describe. (Claude
Code: `/new-requirement <ask>` is a shortcut for typing this out — it is
not a different process, just a saved prompt.)

## Hard rules

- **Stay in persona.** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Developer, QA/Tester each
  own one kind of artifact and one job — see
  `docs/00-roles-and-responsibilities.md`. Don't blend two personas'
  output into one undifferentiated pass.
- **Keep the tracker updated.** Every unit of work gets its own row, with
  real verification evidence (a command actually run, its actual output),
  not a description of intent. `docs/03-spec-driven-development-playbook.md`
  §4 and §7.
- **Keep the traceability matrix current.** A new `REQ-` row without a
  matching `traceability/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` row is a process defect —
  flag it in the next Tech Lead review, don't let it slide.
- **Actually run things.** `mvn compile` / `mvn test` / `mvn spring-boot:run`
  (or the packaged jar) — verify claims by executing them. A tracker row
  that says "implemented" without a command and its output is not
  following the convention.
- **New scope → new `REQ-`.** Don't improvise new behavior mid-implementation;
  follow the propose-new-work protocol (playbook §6) — even for a small
  ask, the artifacts still get written in each persona's voice and logged.

## Quick reference

```bash
mvn compile                  # verify it builds
mvn test                     # run the full suite (22 tests as of PO-01)
mvn spring-boot:run          # run it locally — REST API at /api/v1/{books,members,loans}
mvn clean package            # produce the runnable fat jar
java -jar target/library-lending-service-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar   # run the packaged jar standalone
```

lifecycle.

## Agent-specific notes

- **Claude Code**: this repo also ships `.claude/agents/*.md` (real,
  tool-restricted subagents — one per persona) and `.claude/commands/`
  (`/new-requirement`, `/resume-project`). `CLAUDE.md` imports this file
  and points at those. Use them — they enforce §1's rules rather than just
  stating them.
- **Devin**: this file is read automatically before a session starts
  coding, per Devin's own `AGENTS.md` convention. No further setup should
  be required; if you additionally maintain Devin Knowledge entries for
  this repo, keep them pointed at this file and `docs/03-...md` rather
  than duplicating their content.
- **GitHub Copilot**: the coding agent reads this file natively.
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` also points here for Copilot Chat
  sessions in an IDE, which don't always pick up `AGENTS.md` by default.
