# Spec-Driven Development Playbook

**Audience:** anyone (human or Claude Code session) continuing this
project, or replicating the pattern for a new one.
**Status:** Approved, Tech Lead
**Date:** 2026-09-10

## 1. The problem this solves

An AI coding session has no memory between conversations. Left unaddressed,
every new request either needs a giant prompt re-explaining the whole
system, or the AI re-derives decisions that were already made —
inconsistently, since nothing forces it to reuse the earlier answer.

This repo's fix: **the filesystem is the memory.** A session (or a person)
doesn't need the conversation history that produced this codebase — it
needs to read a fixed, small set of files, in order, and it has everything
a re-briefing would have given it, dated, attributed, and cross-referenced.

## 2. The four-part system

| Part | Answers | Who writes it | Changes how often |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/0N-*.md` (PRD, design) | **What** and **why**; **how** it's architected | PO (requirements), Tech Lead (design) | Rarely — amended by a dated delta, not rewritten |
| `traceability/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` | **Where** each requirement lives: which design section, which code, which test | Tech Lead (created), everyone (kept current) | After every unit of work that touches a requirement |
| `tracker/PROJECT_TRACKER.md` | **What has actually happened**, in order, with proof | Every persona, after every unit of work | After every unit of work — append-only log |
| `CLAUDE.md` (repo root) | **Where to start**, **what the rules are** | Tech Lead | Rarely — it's the index, not the content |

The tracker and the traceability matrix are not the same thing and both
matter: the tracker is chronological (what happened, in what order, proven
how); the matrix is per-requirement (given `FR-4`, what design section,
what code, what test cover it, right now). Lose the tracker and you lose
the history. Lose the matrix and you can't answer "what would break if I
changed `FR-4`" without re-reading the whole codebase.

## 3. The persona discipline

See `docs/00-roles-and-responsibilities.md` for the full table (owns /
writes to / never does per persona, and the subagent each one maps to).
The short version: **Product Owner** (requirements, sign-off) → **Tech
Lead** (design, build review) → **Developer** (implementation + unit
tests) → **QA/Tester** (independent, full-stack verification). Never
blend two personas' output into one undifferentiated paragraph — that
turns the tracker into narration instead of a check on the work.

## 4. The ID convention

| Prefix | Persona | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `REQ-` | Product Owner (requirements) | `REQ-001` |
| `DES-` | Tech Lead (design) | `DES-001` |
| `DEV-` | Developer (implementation stories) | `DEV-01` |
| `TEST-` | QA/Tester (test rounds) | `TEST-01` |
| `TECHLEAD-` | Tech Lead (build/design reviews, after the initial design) | `TECHLEAD-01` |
| `PO-` | Product Owner (sign-offs, after the initial draft) | `PO-01` |

Rules:
- **Never reuse or renumber an ID.** The next one of a given prefix is
  always the next integer, whenever that work happens. Renumbering breaks
  every cross-reference (javadoc, the matrix, other tracker rows) that
  cites it.
- **One row per unit of work.** A session that completes five stories
  writes five rows, not one bundled row.
- **The Notes column carries proof, not intent.** "`mvn test` → 22/22
  pass" belongs in a `Complete` row. "Will add tests" does not — that row
  is `In Progress`, not `Complete`.
- **Every `REQ-` row gets a `traceability/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` row the
  same session it's drafted**, even before design/dev/test exist for it
  (those columns start empty and fill in as the work happens).

## 5. The resume protocol

Given "continue the project" (or `/resume-project`, see
`.claude/commands/resume-project.md`) and nothing else:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` — orientation and hard rules.
2. Read every `docs/0N-*.md` in order.
3. Read `traceability/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` — what's covered, what has a
   gap.
4. Read `tracker/PROJECT_TRACKER.md` end to end, especially the last rows,
   "Open Items / Blockers", and the phase checklist.
5. Resume at the next open item, in the correct persona, logging the same
   way every prior row did.

## 6. The propose-new-work protocol — this is the "simple prompt" mechanism

This is what makes "add a due-date-extension feature" or "let a member
renew a loan" work as a two-sentence ask instead of a re-briefing. See
`docs/04-new-requirement-intake.md` for the literal intake template and
`.claude/commands/new-requirement.md` for the command that runs it.

1. A human states the *what* and *why*, briefly. That's the entire input.
2. **Product Owner** subagent drafts a PRD delta: a new `REQ-XXX` tracker
   row, a new/amended section in `docs/01-po-requirements.md`, and a new
   `traceability/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` row for it.
3. **Tech Lead** subagent drafts the design delta: a `DES-XXX` row, a new
   section in `docs/02-techlead-design.md` naming what's reused vs. new
   and any real design decision explicitly (not improvised mid-code), and
   fills in the matrix row's Design column.
4. **Developer** subagent implements it story by story, each with its own
   `DEV-XXX` row and unit tests, filling in the matrix row's
   Implementation/Tests columns as it goes.
5. **QA/Tester** subagent runs an independent verification pass (`TEST-XXX`
   row) with its own, independently-derived expected values — not values
   copied from the implementation.
6. **Product Owner** signs off (`PO-XXX` row) against the PRD's own
   acceptance criteria.

For a well-understood, small change it's reasonable for one session to
move through all four persona hats in sequence rather than pausing for
approval at each gate — but every artifact still gets written in that
persona's voice and still gets logged. The discipline is in the record,
not in how many separate conversations it takes to produce it.

## 7. Copy-paste templates

**New tracker row:**
```
| <PREFIX>-<NN> | <YYYY-MM-DD> | <Persona> | <one-line description> | `<artifact path>` | <Drafted\|In Review\|Approved\|In Progress\|Complete\|Blocked> | <real evidence: command run + actual output> |
```

**New traceability row:**
```
| <REQ-ID> | <one-line requirement> | <DES-ID + doc section> | <DEV-ID + files> | <TEST-ID + test files> | <Not Started\|In Progress\|Done> |
```

**New PRD delta section** (append to `docs/01-po-requirements.md`):
```markdown
## <N>. <Feature Name> — Added <YYYY-MM-DD>

**Traces to:** `REQ-<NNN>` in the tracker

<What it does, in/out of scope, acceptance criteria — same structure as
the sections around it.>
```

**New design delta section** (append to `docs/02-techlead-design.md`):
```markdown
## <N>. <Feature Name> Architecture — Added <YYYY-MM-DD>

**Traces to:** `DES-<NNN>` in the tracker, `REQ-<NNN>` in the PRD

<What's reused, what's new, and any real design decision named and
justified explicitly.>
```

## 8. What this is not

This isn't process for its own sake. It's the specific answer to one
problem: an AI session (and, often, a human picking work back up weeks
later) has no memory, so the project needs one that lives on disk instead
of in someone's head. A team with shared context some other way doesn't
need this exact mechanism — but a project handed off between people and
between sessions does.
